# CampingForAll
The purpose of this project is to develop a web application to aid people find camping sites/pitches easily for their motorhomes. Web Application will facilitate the platform as manager (anyone who selling their place) or user, where managers can promote their site and any user can find more information about it before making a trip to that place. Once a user created an account and filled out the credentials then they can easily post as much camping sites they want.
