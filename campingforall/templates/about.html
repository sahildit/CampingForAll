          <p>Camping is an outdoor activity involving overnight stays away from home in a shelter, such as tent or
            a recreational vehicle. Typically, participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more
            natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment. The night spent outdoors
            distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking, and other recreational activities</p>
          <p>Motor Homes or campervans is a self-propelled vehicle that provides both transport and
            accommodation. The term mainly describes vans that have been fitted out, often with coach-built
            body for use as accommodation. They usually have sleeping spaces for 2-8 people. Each sleeping
            space is either fixed or converts from another part of motorhome interior, usually a fold-out sofa.
            Kitchen area contains cooking equipment and the types of equipment used are different from
            motorhome makes and model but generally a kitchen has a stovetop, oven, refrigerator, and sink.</p>
          <p>The history of recreational camping is often traced back to Thomas Hiram Holding, a British travelling
            tailor, but it was first popularised in the UK on the river Thames. By the 1880s large numbers of
            visitors took part in the pastime, which was connected to the late Victorian craze for pleasure
            boating. The early camping equipment was very heavy, so it was convenient to transport it by boat
            or to use a craft that converted into a boat. Possibly the first commercial camping ground in the
            world was Cunninghamâ€™s camp, near Douglas, Isle of Man, which opened in 1894</p>
          <p>Although there is a plethora of information on camping and related things on internet, there are not
            many easy-to-use applications available that bring together all the most important features and
            information. It is for the reason Caravan Overloaded is created.
